Israel and Hamas have been at war since October 7, 2023, when the militant Islamist group attacked Israel.
Gaza is bearing the brunt of most of the fighting.
Police have responded to a knife attack in the Israeli city of Holon, south of Tel Aviv.
Meanwhile, fears continue to grow over a potential regional conflict.
DW has the latest.
You can read below for a summary of events concerning Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and other parts of the Middle East from Sunday, August 4.
Jordan's Foreign Minister will make a rare visit to Iran on Sunday amid rising regional tensions, Iranian state media reported.
The Jordanian Foreign Ministry said Safadi will convey a message from King Abdullah II to Iran's newly-elected President Masoud Pezeshkianregarding the situation in the region.
Safadi will also hold "extensive talks" with with his Iranian counterpart Ali Bagheri Kani, the Foreign Ministry added.
Safadi's visit would make him the first senior Jordanian official to visit Iran officially in over 20 years.
During Pezeshkian's inauguration earlier this week, Jordan was represented by a lower-level official.
Since Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's killing in Tehran earlier this week, Iran has held talks with various Arab countries including Jordan, Egypt, Oman and Qatar.
The US and its Arab allies, including Jordan, have meanwhile lobbied hard to prevent a wider escalation.
Iran is likely preparing to go ahead with its vow to target Israel over the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah members, according to DW's Middle East analyst Shani Rozanes.
"I think the fact that we haven't seen anything indicates what we might be seeing, in the sense that this is not going to be a gut response from Iran," she said.
"They're taking their time, they're being very strategic, they're trying to maybe coordinate more forces in the region."
She pointed to Iranian-backed groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria as potential threats in this respect.
Iran, Hezbollah and the Houthis previously launched strikes against Israel in retaliation for what they said was an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria in April.
"The idea is that there was some sort of a threshold that was broken in April, for the first time an unprecedented direct attack from Iran toward Israel.
And this is a threshold that the Iranians have set to themselves," she said, referring to the Iranian strikes.
"So it's probably not going to be less than that.
Which means, last time it was around 300 different kinds of missiles that were shot at Israel — most of them were intercepted — but we're talking about probably this scale.
And now for Iran it's good to keep the Israelis on edge, on high alert."

"This is also partially what Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, wanted.
When he launched the October 7 attack he wanted as many fronts that Israel would have to face as possible," Rozanes said.
"He was hoping not just for Gaza to be there but also the West Bank, what we've been seeing in Lebanon, and what we're seeing now happening in Iran.
In many ways, for Sinwar, this week is finally seeing the wide extension of the goal that he has set himself for a wider conflict in the region."
Regional tensions have soared in the Middle East following the killings of two senior members of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas earlier this week.
An Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah military chief Fouad Shukr in Beirut on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Iran and others have blamed Israel for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday.
Both Hezbollah and Hamas are classified as terror groups by several countries.
Iran and Iranian-backed groups have vowed to take "vengeance" against Israel over the two killings.
In comments published on Saturday, the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, General Hossein Salami, said that Israel and its supporters "must reckon with the holy wrath of the resistance groups."
Iran's non-state allies include the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as militias in Iraq and Syria.
Observers fear threats posed by these groups could result in a wider regional war, some 10 months after Israel began its military offensive in Gaza in response to the October 7 terror attack by Hamas.
In recent days, Western governments notably issued new travel warnings for Lebanon in particular.
A second person has died from a knife attack in Holon, Israel, after he succumbed to his wounds.
The Shamir-Assaf Harofeh Medical Center announced that a man in his 80s had died after he was taken to hospital, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
A woman in her 80s had earlier died at the scene, while two other people were hospitalized with injuries.
France urged its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately on Sunday as fears grow over a broader Middle East conflict.
The move follows similar calls by Britain and the United States on Saturday.
A number of international airlines have canceled flights to and from Beirut.
Iran and Iran-backed groups in the Middle East have vowed to take revenge following Israel's assassination of Hezbollah military chief Fuad Shukr in Beirut and by the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.
One person has died and at least three others were injured in a knife attack in the Israeli city of Holon, south of Tel Aviv, on Sunday morning.
The Magen David Adom ambulance service said a 70-year-old woman died, while three men were all taken to hospital.
"A policeman who arrived at the scene neutralized the stabber," the Israeli Police said on social media, suggesting the perpetrator was killed.
Police also said the attacker was a resident of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Many Western governments are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon.
The death of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran under the watch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard has raised questions about Iran's security apparatus.
Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Tehran on Tuesday for the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian, received a warm reception in the office of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Two days later, the Iranian supreme leader wassaying a funeral prayerat Haniyeh's coffin.
The 85-year-old Ayatollah does not seem to have recovered from theshock of Haniyeh's killinginIran's capital.
At the memorial service on Thursday, Khamenei was seen looking anxiously into the sky several times and observing his surroundings.
Senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya told a news conference in Tehran on Wednesday that Haniyeh was struck "directly" by a guided projectile while he was lodging in the Iranian president's guest house in the Saadabad Palace complex.
To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video This complex is located on a hillside in the foothills of the Alborz Mountains to the north of Tehran.
The area surrounding the palace complex is freely accessible, and mountain climbing in this region is one of the capital's leisure activities.
Haniyeh could also possibly have been killed by a quadcopter, a small helicopter drone rigged with explosives, a source told the Swiss daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung and the UK-based news website Amwaj.media.
The New York Times reported on Thursday, citing "seven Middle Eastern officials, including two Iranians" that a bomb had been planted two months ago in the guesthouse where Haniyeh was staying, which is secured by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps.
"I looked at the pictures of the building he was in.
From the minor damage to the building, I can't say exactly what was used," Fabian Hinz, an expert in drone and missile systems at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, told DW.
"The damage to the building was very limited.
It is quite possible that a quadcopter was used.
There are quadcopters that are controlled on site, or those that are controlled via satellites and the internet.
But it could also have been other munitions," he added.
Regardless ofhow the attack took place, the fact is that Haniyeh's whereabouts were no secret.
This was not the first time the Hamas political leader had been to Tehran.
He last traveled there in May 2024 to attend the funeral of President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in April.
"Haniyeh knew that Tehran was not safe for him," Guido Steinberg, Middle East and terrorism researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in Berlin, told DW.
"Tehran is not even capable of protecting its own top people, such as the nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh," Steinberg added, refering the the killing of one of Iran's top scientists.
Fakhrizadeh, who wasassassinated near Tehran in November 2020, was one of the best-protected people in Iran.
As a key figure in Iran's nuclear program, he had been known to the global public since May 2018.
Israel had repeatedly stated it considered Iran's nuclear weapons program to be threat to its security.
Now, Israel has vowed to eliminate Hamas, following theOctober 7 terrorist attacks, during which nearly 1,200 people were killed, and over 230 taken hostage, of which around 110 are thought to remain in captivity in Gaza.

Since the 1979 revolution, the hardline Shiite leadership of the Islamic Republic does not officially recognize Israel's right to exist.
Iran considers itself as a dominant regional power and a center of resistance to what it would see as expansionism by competing powers in the region.
Tehran also supports the so-called "Axis of Resistance," which includes militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.
Both groups are classified as terrorist organizations by the US, the European Union and others.
The Israeli government has not commented on the recent killing of the Hamas leader.
However, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds Israel responsible and has threatened "severe punishment."

Students clashed with police and ruling party activists in Dhaka and other cities.
A controversial quota system for public sector jobs has been scrapped but the protests turned into an anti-government movement.
At least 24 people were killed Sunday across Bangladesh, local media reported, as student protesters clashed with activists from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ruling Awami League.
The Interior Ministry declared an indefinite nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. (1200 GMT), in the first such move since the protests started.
The demonstrations broke out in June against a controversial quota system for public sector recruitment, which the country's Supreme Court has now all but scrapped.
Students returned to the streets this week in huge numbers, in an all-out non-cooperation movement aimed at paralyzing the government and demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation.

Protest organizers had urged people not to pay taxes and utility bills and not show up for work in a show of "non-cooperation" with the government.
Sunday is a working day in Bangladesh but many shops and banks in Dhaka stayed closed.
At one stage, thousands of protesters attacked a major public hospital in Dhaka's Shahbagh area, torching several vehicles, the police said.
A police officer, who asked not to be named, told the French AFP news agency that "the whole city has turned into a battleground."
In the capital's Uttara neighborhood, police fired teargas to disperse hundreds of protesters who blocked a major highway.
At least 24 people were killed and dozens were injured across the country, according to a tally by DW based on hospital, police and local media sources.
The death toll included two people who were declared dead from their injuries on arrival at a hospital in Munshiganj district near Dhaka, a hospital official said.

Around 30 people were injured.
Four people were killed in clashes between ruling party activists and protesters in the northwestern Rangpur city.
Five people died when Awami League activists attacked protesters in the southeastern city of Feni, local media reported.
At least three people were killed and 50 hurt in the northeastern district of Pabna during a clash between protesters and Awami League activists, witnesses said.
Three more were killed when police opened fire on protesters in the northern district of Bogura, the Daily Star reported.
Two people were killed in the northern city of Kishioreganj, where protesters torched a ruling party office, police said.
Five people were killed — one each in the northwestern city of Sirajganj, as well as Magura — which is located in the southwest, Savar — near Dhaka, south-central Barishal, and Cumilla — which lies in the east, the newspaper said.
The student protests erupted nearly two months ago over a longstanding quota system for public sector jobs that favors descendants of ex-military personnel who fought for the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971, as well as other groups.
The government had shelved the quota system but a court challenge paved the way for it to be reintroduced until a ruling from the Supreme Court ordered the ex-military quota to be reduced from 30% to 5%.
The Court ruled that 93% of jobs should be allocated on merit, with the remaining 2% set aside for minority groups.
The protests died down for several days, but have since turned into an anti-government movement, and students are now demanding justice for the victims of police brutality during the crackdown.
Over the past month, more than 200 people have been killed, thousands injured and about 10,000 arrested in connection with the protests.
Government critics, along with human rights groups, accuse Hasina's government of using excessive force to stamp out the movement, which it denies.

German dressage rider Jessica von Bredow-Werndl has taken her second gold medal at the Olympic Games in Paris, winning the solo event.
Meanwhile, her teammate Isabell Werth took silver.
German dressage rider Jessica von Bredow-Werndl continued her Olympic gold streak on Sunday, this time winning in the individual dressage event at the Paris Olympics.
A day earlier, she and teammates Isabell Werth and Frederic Wandres clinched the team gold.
With an impressive freestyle Grand Prix routine, von Bredow-Werndl finished in top place, ahead of fellow German Isabell Werth and Briton Charlotte Fry.
The 38-year-old and her mare Dalera performed highly complex and difficult maneuvers to a medley of French chanson music.
Werth also put on a gala performance in the freestyle.
The 55-year-old, whose first gold came at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, thrilled the 15,000 spectators with a routine set to a pastiche of the Barry Manilow romantic ballad "Mandy."
The lyrics were rewritten to "Wendy," the name of Werth's mare.
Bredow-Werndl was awarded 90.093 percentage points, Werth secured 89.614, and world champion Fry, riding Glamourdale, received 88.971.
For von Bredow-Werndl it was a repeat of a double victory in Tokyo's Olympic Games in 2021.
A day earlier, Werth and von Bredow-Werndl had already won a gold medal in the team Grand Prix.
But the pair had little time to celebrate, with preparations for the freestyle — that saw them pitted as rivals — beginning that evening.
With the narrow team victory on Saturday, Werth became Germany's record medalist with a tally that, after the individual event, now includes eight golds and six silvers.
Canoeist Birgit Fischer is Germany's number two, having won eight Olympic gold medals and four silver medals in her career.
"That's very, very special," Werth said of her Olympic record.
"Of course, that makes me proud."
"I'm going for a drink with Birgit soon," she added.
"We both really achieved something.
We sweat blood and water."

The two nations will collaborate on military training and weapons procurement, as tensions in the South China Sea escalate.
China is in dispute with several Asian neighbors for control of the critical trade route.
Germany and the Philippines on Sunday said they planned to sign a defense agreement later this year to expand cooperation between their armed forces.
During talks in Manila, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and his Philippine counterpart Gilberto Teodoro committed to work more closely on military training and weapons procurement.
The partnership comes at a time when China is flexing its military muscles in disputed areas of the South China Sea, although Pistorius was at pains to stress the cooperation was not aimed at any specific country.
"Instead, we are focussing on maintaining rules-based order, securing freedom of navigation and protecting trade routes," Pistorius said.
To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The Philippines has committed $35 billion (€32 billion) over the next decade to modernize its military to boost external defense capabilities amid escalating tensions with Beijing.
Manila has signed defense cooperation deals with other countries, including the United States, Japan, India and Sweden.
Teodoro said the Philippines would be "looking to engage Germany as a possible supplier of these [training and weapons] capabilities."
"These are in the command and control, anti-access aerial denial, maritime domain, aerial domain and in higher technologically capable equipment," he told a joint news conference.
Pistorius said the deal could be signed as early as October.
Pistorius and Teodoro said they "strongly opposed any unilateral attempt to advance expansive claims, especially through force or coercion."
Teodoro said the Philippines was not provoking Beijing and did not seek war, but said the standoff was simply due to "China's illegal and unilateral attempt to appropriate most if not all of the South China Sea".
Manila has had run-ins in recent months with Beijing over the disputed waters in the Indo-Pacific.
Recently, the Philippines accused the Chinese military of intentionally ramming Manila's navy boats, seriously injuring a Filipino sailor.
China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including areas claimed as exclusive economic zones by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia.
In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague said Beijing's claims had no legal basis.
China rejects that decision.
The South China Sea is a vital trade route with more than $3 trillion in ship-borne goods and commodities passing through it every year, some 60% of global maritime trade.
Germany on Friday joined the U.S.-led United Nations Command in South Korea, becoming the 18th nation in a group that helps police the heavily fortified border with North Korea.
The UN Command has committed to defend the South in the event of a war.
Sunday's visit to Manila was a first by a German defense minister, as their countries mark 70 years of diplomatic relations.

Nigerian President Tinubu said he has "heard" those protesting against high costs of living, urging them to create room for dialogue.
Amnesty International said 13 had been killed since demonstrations flared up.
Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu called on Sunday on citizens to stop protests where at least 13 have so far been killed, in the president's first public comments since the demonstrations erupted last week.
Thousands of demonstrators have taken the street to express frustration over the high cost of living.
Tinubu urged the demonstrators to stop protesting and "create room for dialogue," in a televised address.
"My dear Nigerians, especially our youth, I have heard you loud and clear.
I understand the pain and the frustration that drive these protests, and I want to assure you that our government is committed to listening and addressing the concerns of our citizens," he said.
"But we must not let violence and destruction tear our nation apart," Tinubu added.
"We must stop further bloodshed, violence and destruction."
Tinubu also announced a plan that would benefit the youth and economy of the most populous African nation.
Protesters demand that the government reduce fuel prices and address Nigeria's most severe economic crisis, with inflation reaching a 28-year high of around 34%.
Since taking over in May 2023, Tinubu has introduced controversial economic reforms, including a partial end to petrol and electricity subsidies and a devaluation of the local currency.
Protests took a violent turn on Thursday with at least 13 people killed during clashes with security forces, said rights group Amnesty International.
However, authorities downplayed the death toll, saying only seven had died as of Saturday.
Four were killed due to an explosion in Borno state, two were hit by a car and one was shot by a guard when some protesters were trying to steal from a shop, they added.
Police had arrested about 700 within the first two days of protest, they said.
Security forces have been accused of using excessive force against protesters, which they deny.

Germany's foreign minister emphasized the need to deploy long-range US weapons systems on German soil.
Weapons like the SM-6, Tomahawk and developmental hypersonic weapons would deter Russia, she said.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock defended an agreement with Washington on the stationing of long-range US missiles in Germany, citing the threat Russia poses to European security.
"Making foreign policy today means recognizing that the principle of hope will not protect us from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's Russia," Baerbock wrote in an opinion piece for the German weekly Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
"What protects us now is that we invest in our own security and strength — in the EU, in NATO and in Germany.
And this includes the decision to deploy long-range American weapons systems," she added.
The minister emphasized that Germany needs "a credible deterrent" against Russia, "which also protects the Poles, the Baltic peoples and the Finns — our partners who share a direct border with Russia and have experienced how it is using hybrid measures at the border in recent months."
Baerbock accused Putin of responding to every peace initiative with escalation, writing that he wants only for "Ukraine to submit to him."
On the sidelines of a NATO summit in July, the United States and Germany agreed to the deployment of long-range fire capabilities on German soil starting in 2026.

The decision received a mixed reaction in Berlin, with some greeting and others criticizing it.
Several parties, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's own center-left Social Democrats, have criticized the plan and called for it to be referred to parliament for debate.

Clashes between anti-immigration and anti-racism groups continued for a fourth night with violence across the UK.
Several people have been arrested and the government has warned of strong penalties.
British police were injured in clashes with far-right protesters as violent riots continued across towns and cities in the UK on Saturday.
In the northwestern city of Liverpool, protesters threw chairs, flares and bricks at police officers.
Manchester also saw clashes between officers and rioters.
In the city of Hull, protesters broke windows of a hotel that was housing migrants, the BBC reported.
In Belfast, in Northern Ireland, fireworks were thrown due to a clash between an anti-Islam group and anti-racism protesters.
Opposing groups also faced off in the cities of Nottingham and Bristol.
In Leeds, anti-immigration protesters carrying British flags chanted, "You're not English anymore."
They were met with counter-protesters shouting, "Nazi scum off our streets."
On Friday, Sunderland saw violence erupt as a police station and an overturned car were set on fire.
Arrests have been made across the country, with more expected.
"Criminal violence and thuggery on our streets will not be tolerated," UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said, adding that those who engage in criminal disorder will face "the strongest possible penalties."
In London, a pro-Palestinian demonstration was carried out as usual despite counterprotesting nearby.
The riots began last week due to misinformation over a mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party at a studio in Southport, a seaside town in northwest England.
Three children were killed in the knife attack, and 10 other people — eight of whom were children — were injured.
A 17-year-old boy, Axel Rudakubana, has been charged with several offenses, including the girls' murder, which happened during a Taylor Swift-themed workshop.
Rudakubana is accused of killing Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, and injuring another 10 people.
Since the Southport attack, far-right social media channels have been awash with false claims that the suspect was an asylum-seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat.
Police have emphasized that Rudakubana was born in Britain.
He was remanded to a youth detention center and will next appear in court in October.
The unrest is seen as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first major test after joining office less than a month ago.
He has condemned the violence and said thugs were "hijacking" the nation's grief.
"The government backs the police to take all necessary action to keep our streets safe," said a statement from Starmer's office.
Police believe the English Defence League, an anti-Islam organization, is behind the organizing of the violence.
Anti-racism campaign group Hope Not Hate says it has identified 30 more such events set to take place over the weekend.

It has been 23 years since over 2,000 people were displaced in Uganda to make way for a coffee plantation for the German company Neumann.
Since then, they have been fighting for justice in court.
In 2001, more than 4,000 people were evicted from their land in Uganda after it had been acquired by German coffee firm Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG) on a 99-year lease.
Many of the residents of Kyengeza village in Mubende district were forcefully driven off their land, which lies approximately 140 kilometers (87 miles) from Uganda's capital Kampala, to make way for a 2,500-hectare (4.9 acres) coffee plantation.
NKG has maintained that its lease of the land from the Ugandan government was signed in good faith.
The company also acknowledged that 25 families in the Mubende district resisted relocation and were subsequently removed by government authorities.
In 2002, farmers sued the government in Kampala, as well as NKG and its Ugandan subsidiary, Kaweri Coffee Plantation.
NKG claimed the Ugandan government compensated 166 families, however many Ugandans, including Scola Namuyanja, claim that no compensation has been paid to them.
The 67-year-old woman said she still recalls what happened more than two decades ago.
"We heard President Yoweri Museveni announce that he had given our land to investors and that we would be compensated for all our property — our land, our house, our crops," said Namuyanja.
The government had promised them a new strip of land, where a school and a health center were to be built.
But there was only forest, Namuyanja said.
"There was no school, no hospital — not even a water source.
That's why we didn't move.
When the deadline expired, army soldiers came and evicted us by force," she recounted.
Today, the elderly woman lives with her sons and grandchildren in a simple mud hut at the edge of the plantation.
To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to Uganda's constitution, foreign companies are not permitted to buy land outright — they can only lease it for a specified period.
In the case of the coffee plantation, the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) purchased the 2,500 hectares in Mubende in April 2001 and then leased it to NKG's subsidiary, Kaweri Coffee Plantation.
NKG is a long-established company based in Hamburg.
With 60 subsidiaries across 27 countries, it stands as a leading entity in the green coffee sector.
Aside from Uganda, the company also operates plantations in Mexico and Brazil.
The company declined to comment about the legal dispute in Uganda, but did state it had agreed with the Ugandan government that only so-called clean title land would be considered for a subsequent lease — in other words, land that is free from claims by third parties.
In the first verdict in 2013, the Ugandan government was acquitted.
Landowner Kayiwa was ordered to pay €11 million ($12 million) in compensation, however he appealed the ruling and has since died.
The plaintiffs are trying to assert their claims with the Ugandan government.
With the help of the German human rights network FIAN, the farmers filed a complaint with the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in 2015.
Since then, numerous high-ranking politicians have been involved in attempts to reach an out-of-court settlement.
It was not until 2017, partly due to pressure from the German government, that representatives of the Ugandan president presented the plaintiffs with an offer for a settlement.
All further hearings were delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In April 2021, a final agreement was reached with a compensation package of less than €1 million euros — a fraction of the €30 million originally demanded.
"I remember how the judge insisted at the time that these people should be paid immediately," said Francis Katabalva, a lawyer who has been helping displaced families for 22 years.
"Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet."
For 143 of those affected, including Scola Namuyanja, this was not enough.
They want their land back.
Their lawsuit was transferred to the High Court in Mubende in 2022 — with the condition that the process be reopened from scratch.
Namuyanja refuses to give up.
"I am still demanding that Neumann compensates us and does not expand the plantation so as not to take this land away from me too."

They blame the government for a violent crackdown on protests against government job quotas.
More than 200 people were killed.
While German politicians have generally expressed relief over the successful exchange of prisoners with Russia and Belarus, they are also having a thoughtful discussion about what the price may be.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was visibly relieved about the historic prisoner exchange with Russia this Friday as he greeted 12 of the released prisoners at the Cologne Bonn Airport.
Their reception was reserved in comparison to the jubilant scenes in Washington, where US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris embraced journalist Evan Gershkovich and other former prisoners in front of media.
Scholz spoke only a few words, saying that the exchange had only been possible "through intensive cooperation with many European countries and especially with the United States of America over a very long period of time."
He went on to say that he believed this agreement had been the right decision in the end, and that anyone with doubts would reconsider after speaking to those who were now free.
Independent of any moral or ethical assessment, the exchange was a major diplomatic achievement.
Russia released 16 prisoners in the exchange, among them four with German passports.
In return, eight Russians were released, including the "Tiergarten murderer" Vadim Krassikov.
He was sentenced to life in prison in late 2021 after a Berlin court found him guilty of fatally shooting a Georgian of Chechen origin in the city's central Tiergarten park in August 2019.

But unlike many debates on current political issues, this one has been thoughtful and moderate.
Leading opposition politicians from the conservative Christian Democratic Union expressed their fundamental approval, perhaps in part because Scholz announced that CDU leader Friedrich Merz had received advance notice and signaled his agreement.
CDU foreign affairs expert Norbert Röttgen told national broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that while Germany had accepted a "serious disadvantage," it was "justified by the human gain, by freedom and the liberation from torture for 16 people."
Michael Roth, foreign affairs expert for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) summed up the German dilemma succinctly in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), writing that sometimes one is called to to "make a deal with the devil for the sake of humanity."
In this case the devil was Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Asked about the legal basis on which Germany acted, Christian Mihr, deputy secretary general for Amnesty International in Germany, told DW: "International humanitarian law contains rules on the exchange of prisoners of war.
In the current case, however, we are not dealing with prisoners of war and there are no fixed rules with which states must comply."
There are also no provisions for prisoner exchanges in German law.
The government used Section 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that a prison sentence can be waived under certain conditions.
This decision was reached on behalf of the federal government by Justice Minister Marco Buschmann of the libertarian Free Democratic Party (FDP).
Observers agree that the exchange came about primarily because Putin wanted convicted murderer Krassikov, while US President Biden was motivated by the release of Gershkovich.
Does that mean that Germany, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz in particular, caved to pressure from the US in agreeing to release a murderer from a German prison?
Günter Krings, the CDU's legal policy spokesman, said that the legal system cannot be "arbitrarily subordinated to foreign policy considerations."
He considers the exchange to be fundamentally wrong, though he concedes that he is the lone member of his party to hold this opinion.
Some politicians have also expressed fears about what the consequences of the deal might be.
"From a human perspective, this deal was probably the only way for some political prisoners like Vladimir Kara-Mursa and Evan Gershkovich to escape alive from Russian hostage-taking," CDU security expert Roderich Kiesewetter told DW.
But Russia is a terrorist state that is waging a war against our way of life, he added.
"This includes the fact that hostage diplomacy is intended to create precisely this dilemma."
The dilemma being that the rule of law must violate its own principles to save lives.
Kara-Mursa is a Russian-British politician and journalist who was the target of at least two poison attacks and sentenced to 25 years in prison in April 2023 for condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
But could the successful exchange mean that new diplomatic lines of communication with the Kremlin might help to end the war in Ukraine?
Political scientist David Sirakov, who directs the Atlantic Academy Rhineland-Palatinate, a non-profit institution that fosters transatlantic relations, warned against such optimism.
"This is not a confidence-building measure, nor does it raise hopes for a better relationship with Moscow or Minsk," he told German news wire DPA.

The situation is escalating.
Neither "pro-Israel" nor "pro-Palestine": Two young activists who identify as Palestinian-Israeli have started a podcast to seek alternatives to violence and polarization.
They want their identity to be recognized.
Maoz Inon's parents were among the first victims of the Hamas attacks in Israel on the morning of October 7.
Yet two days after the tragedy, despite his pain, it was very clear to him that he didn't want revenge.
"Revenge won't bring my parents back.
Nor will it bring back any of the other Israelis and Palestinians who have been killed," he wrote soon afterward.
That night, Inon, an Israeli entrepreneur and peace activist, had a dream.
He describes it in an interview for the podcast "Unapologetic: The Third Narrative."
The ground before him was thick with blood, and he was weeping — along with the whole of humanity, all wounded by the war.
"We were crying, we were all crying.
And our tears went down our face and to our bodies, and washed our bodies, and healed us… And then our tears went down to the ground and washed the blood."
It wasn't a nightmare, says Inon.
It was a vision of a better future without bloodshed.
Hamze Awawde also dreams about the conflict.
On the same podcast, the Palestinian author and peace activist talks of dreaming that Israeli soldiers have come to kill him and his family, just as they killed his cousin.
To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Awawde says he became a peace activist because he believes hope is not a feeling but something that you do.
"Waiting for two states feels like waiting for the Messiah," he wrote in one of his recent essays.
What Awade and Inon have in common is their hope for an end to the current war in Gaza, which has claimed the lives of nearly 40,000 civilians according to recent death tolls.
That is why they were invited onto the podcast.
The format was established in October 2023, after the Hamas-led attack in Israel.
Germany, the US, the EU and others designate Hamas as a terrorist group.
The two founders, Amira Mohammed and Ibrahim Abu Ahmad, are among the many Arabs in Israel who have Israeli citizenship.
According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, this group constitutes around 17% of the population.
In total, at least 21% of people living on Israeli territory are Arab.
Amira and Ibrahim define themselves as Palestinian Israelis.
Surveys show that the majority of their community does the same.
On a political level, though, it's an identity they have to fight for, as the state of Israel rejects the possibility of Palestinian identity for its citizens.
Instead, it refers to them as "Arab Israelis."
In an interview with DW, Amira explains that she is convinced Palestinian Israelis like her could, and should, play a key role in the Middle East conflict precisely because of their identity.
"Whether it's about if you want to call what's going on a war or genocide, or what exactly happened on October 7, or on the number of the people dying in Gaza — we're not going to agree.
But we have to agree on the future," she says.
Amira and Ibrahim envision a future beyond the current polarization.
"What we want to create here, with this initiative, is a third narrative in the West," Ibrahim explains.
This is why they are primarily addressing a Western audience.
"What the West created is a sense of a black-and-white.
You're either pro-Israeli, or you're pro-Palestinian," Ibrahim comments in the first episode.
"Instead of using it like a football match, cheering for Messi or Ronaldo, you guys [in the West] should use your platform to criticize all parties equally," says his colleague Mohammed.
Their approach has proved to be successful.
The podcast has as many as 180,000 listeners per episode and around 30,000 followers on Instagram.
However, despite their success, the two activists deal with setbacks daily.
There is resistance from all sides, Mohammed says.
When she speaks Arabic in public, Israelis look at her with alarm.
And when she speaks Hebrew without an Arab accent, Palestinians don't trust her.
"Everyone starts to delegitimize you, in a way.
If I am 'too Israeli,' I am siding with the oppressor.
If I am 'too proud of being a Palestinian,' I am justifying terror, I'm a 'bad Arab,'" she says.
Mohammed is convinced that the dual identity she shares with many others is a source of untapped potential in this conflict.
"We know both cultures.
We can feel the Palestinian pain.
But we can also feel the pain of the Israelis," she says.
"But as long as we are not recognized as Palestinian Israelis, we cannot be the kind of translator, the medium.
We're a minority, but we want to be represented and seen as what we are."
She was especially conscious of her dual identity on October 7.
"It was a disaster of emotions.
I didn't know what I am supposed to feel."
As Mohammed sought shelter from the bombs in a stairwell in southern Israel, not far from Gaza, she was glued to her phone, watching images of the events happening in real-time.
She saw Palestinians break through the border fence that, for the past 30 years, had confined them to Gaza's 365 square kilometers — an area not even half the size of Hamburg, with a population of more than two million.
"Seeing those Gazans flee out, seeing that liberation, I felt a little bit of relief.
They deserve to be free," Mohammed says.
But the people who broke through the fence were not in search of freedom.
They murdered at least 1,200 people, set fire to homes, and took hundreds of hostages back with them to Gaza.
Still in the stairwell, Mohammed started seeing pictures of the corpses of young women and hostages being taken to Gaza.
The building she was in was shaking as bombs fell around it.
And she remembers thinking: "This could also have been me.
This was the moment in which I felt my Israeli side."
More than nine months after the Hamas attack on Israel, the war in Gaza continues.
It has taken a terrible toll: According to the UN, more than 39,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza, and 120 hostages, both Israeli and of other nationalities, are still being held captive by Hamas.
There is no immediate prospect of peace.
Nonetheless, the two podcasters continue their work.
They want to show solidarity with both Palestinians and Israelis and be allowed to criticize both sides without having to justify themselves, says Mohammed.
"We want to stop the bloodshed.
Palestinians, Israelis, Christians, Jews, Muslims — we all deserve better."

Two boxers are in the spotlight for competing at the Paris Olympics despite failing gender tests over a year ago at the World Boxing Championships.
Their cases have highlighted a bitter feud between the IOC and IBA.
In one corner, you have the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the most powerful institution in world sport.
In the other, you have the International Boxing Association (IBA), amateur boxing's global governing body, which is no longer officially recognized by the IOC.
It offers an insight into how and why the cases of two female boxers competing at the Paris Olympics have been thrust into the public spotlight, exposing a yearslong feud between the two organizations and reigniting a debate over fairness, safety and inclusion in women's sport.
DW looks at what is behind the issues and where boxing and its Olympic competition go from here.
Unwittingly caught in the middle of this, through no fault of their own, are the two boxers: Imane Khelif of Algeria and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, who are said by the IBA to have failed gender tests during the World Boxing Championships in March 2023, with no information provided as to what the tests consisted of.
Both Khelif and Lin have since become the victims of abuse and false assertions on social media, which has been called "unacceptable" by Andrea Florence, director of the Sports & Rights Alliance, a coalition of human rights groups.
"The obsessive speculation around women's bodies under the guise of 'fair play' is rooted in harmful gender and racial stereotypes," Florence said.
The feud between the IOC and the IBA stems from the 2016 Rio Olympics.
Allegations of judges fixing fights during the Games in Brazil were confirmed by an independent investigation and led to the IOC demanding that the IBA clean up its act or risk losing its status as a governing body.
As an interim measure, the IOC took over the running of the boxing competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, as it has also done here in Paris.
However, far from improving its governance in the meantime, the IBA further angered the IOC when it reelected Umar Kremlev as president without contest in 2022.
Kremlev, a Russian businessman with ties to the Kremlin, has been a vocal critic of the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, and the IBA was derecognized after an IOC vote in June 2023.
"The boxers fully deserve to be governed by an international federation with integrity and transparency," Bach said at the time.
The consequences of that vote, though, have created a disparity in the way amateur boxing competitions are run and, it appears, their rules.
While it is no longer involved at the Olympics, the IBA still controls its world championships, where the controversy erupted.
"I don't think any of these organizations are models to look at when it comes to boxing," Dr. Joanna Harper, author of the book "Sporting Gender," told DW in an interview.
However, Harper cautioned that "bad actors" had attempted to gain political capital from the situation, adding: "There are some people who are trying to make a political case that people who don't fit easily into the male-female divide are men, masquerarding as women, trying to ruin women's sports.
Those people have very bad intentions."
Khelif and Lin were both disqualified from the 2023 World Boxing Championships in New Delhi and subsequently suspended from future IBA events.
The IBA decided that the pair had been ineligible to compete after undergoing gender tests, to uphold "the integrity of the competition."
At the time, Kremlev told Russian state news agency TASS that DNA testing of the two boxers had "proved that they have XY (male) chromosomes," and that they had "tried to deceive their colleagues and pretended to be women."
Khelif had beaten Russian boxer Azalia Amineva in the quarterfinals of the championships.
News of the failed gender tests went largely unnoticed in 2023 but was brought to wider attention just days before Khelif's first Olympic fight in Paris on Thursday.
The IOC has stressed that the boxers are not transgender and has sought to undermine the credibility of what it called the "arbitrary" tests, even suggesting that they had something to do with "not liking the results that had happened," apparently referring to Khelif's bout against Amineva.
"We have no knowledge of what the tests were, they were cobbled together overnight," spokesperson Mark Adams said at the IOC's daily briefing on Friday.
Adding to the confusion, though, the IOC had written on a portal for the media that Khelif had "elevated levels of testosterone."
This information was later deleted, but the IOC acknowledged that it had been taken as "fact."
Although it remains unclear what exactly their medical condition is, Harper said that the two boxers "probably" have a difference of sexual development (DSD), meaning that they have XY chromosomes and can display characteristics typical to males, including how they respond to testosterone, a hormone that can increase muscle mass and strength.
The IOC says that the boxing competition in Paris is being conducted under exactly the same rules as the ones in Rio and Tokyo, where the sex listed on an athlete's passport is the key criteria.
Asked by DW if the IOC, knowing the situation with the gender tests, could have prevented the furor from occuring before the Olympics, Adams said that a different question needed to be asked.
"Are these athletes women?
The answer is yes, according to eligibility, according to their passports, according to their history," he said.
Those remarks were echoed by Bach at his press conference on Saturday.
"There was never any doubt about them being women," he said.
"Some want to own the definition of who is a woman.
We will not take part in a politically motivated cultural war."
However, Harper says the IOC's policy doesn't look at the "significant" safety issue.
"It's not clear with DSD athletes how much stronger they are on a pound for pound basis," she said.
"And in the boxing world, the safety issue comes down to pound for pound strength, because you're putting together people of the same size.
I would say if they haven't had testosterone suppression, I would have concerns."
In the short term, both boxers will continue in their respective catagories in the competition.
"You cannot just come out and disqualify somebody and establish the rules afterwards," Christian Klaue, another IOC spokesperson, added on Friday.
In the longer term, the IOC may revisit its overall policy on gender eligibility, although Harper acknowledges that "there is no singular solution that is going to make everyone happy."
Boris van der Vorst, the president of World Boxing, which is positioning itself to take over as the sport's global body, told the Associated Press that his organization would always put "athletes' safety first" when it came to developing policies, but added that "when people are eligible to compete, we have to respect them."
Meanwhile, critics of Kelif's and Lin's participation in the female category have called for boxers to be sex tested, a practice that was stopped at the Olympics before the Sydney Games in 2000.
Minky Worden of Human Rights Watch backs the IOC on this matter.
"So-called 'sex tests' of women athletes and Olympians are unscientific, degrading, discredited, abusive, and never happen to men," she said.

Zheng Qinwen beat Croatia's Donna Vekic in the women's singles final on the clay courts of Paris on Saturday.
The 21-year-old sixth seed needed just two sets, winning 6-2, 6-3.
Zheng Qinwen became China's first-ever tennis singles Olympic champion on Saturday, beating Donna Vekic of Croatia 6-2, 6-3 in the final on the clay courts of Roland Garros.
Zheng held her serve in the last game to seal the win, rounding out the match with a well-placed forehand winner.
She then collapsed onto her back with joy on court, dropping her racket and raising her arms in the air.
A large contingent of Chinese fans were on hand to cheer the rising star and world number 7 towards victory.
"For the final today the atmosphere was incredible, all the Chinese fans yelling for me.
Two years ago that would have been pressure but today I kept calm and handled it well," Zheng said after the game.
"This Olympic journey has not been easy, I had a lot of tough fights and some matches I nearly lost," Zheng said.
Perhaps the most notable of these tough fights was Zheng's quarterfinal win over Germany's veteran Angelique Kerber, playing the last tournament of a storied professional career, which went all the way to a tie-break in the third and final set.
China had never won a singles tennis medal at the Olympics, but Li Ting and Sun Tian-Tian did claim women's doubles gold in Athens in 2004.
Both women were vying for the same honor on Saturday — no Croatian player has ever won singles gold either — but Zheng was the bookmaker's favorite and the higher-ranked player going into the match.
Donna Vekic said that even claiming silver on Saturday was "incredible" given her ordeals in recent years that she said had led her to considering retirement as recently as last month.
She's been struggling to return to full fitness after major knee surgery in 2021.
The 28-year-old, 21st in the WTA rankings, said that after her impressive but grueling run to the semi-finals in Wimbledon earlier in July, she nearly pulled out of the Olympics.
"After the Wimbledon semi-finals, I had so much pain everywhere that I was debating going to the Olympics because I thought 'in these conditions, there is no way I can win a medal'," she told reporters.
"When we had our first practice, I told my coach I was coughing so bad I couldn't hit two shots in a row.
One week later, we have a medal.
So it's been absolutely, absolutely incredible," Vekic said.
Meanwhile, world number one, Iga Swiatek of Poland claimed bronze at the expense of Slovakia's Anna Karolina Schmiedlova in the third-place playoff on Friday.

One of the most important African American writers, James Baldwin, would have turned 100 on August 2.
James Baldwin was born in the New York district of Harlem in 1924, when the world was already deeply racist.
Poverty was rampant and there was police violence.
Baldwin grew up with eight siblings.
His stepfather was a strict Baptist preacher who greatly influenced him and he initially became a preacher himself.
But Baldwin did not want to accept the boundaries imposed upon him by society.
He had a dream, and that was to write.
First, he published reviews, followed by essays and short stories.
New York, even the whole of the US, became too constricted for him.
He felt oppressed both as a Black person and as a gay man.
He moved toFrance where he ended up staying 40 years — with interruptions.
The novels that made Baldwin famous were written in his adopted home of France.
In "Go Tell It on the Mountain," which was published in 1953, he wrote about his childhood and teenage experiences in his hometown Baptist church.
"Giovanni's Room" (1956) caused a stir because it was about a bisexual man's search for identity.
Baldwin returned to the US for a few more years.
It was the time of the African American civil rights movement, in which he became an important figure.
He was friends with civil rights icons Martin Luther KingJr., Malcolm X and the singer Nina Simone.
Baldwin was driven by the hope for change and for reconciliation.
He wanted neither a white nor a Black nation.
His vision was a nation of individuals, regardless of color; a vision that he believed could only be achieved in America.
And yet there was also a great deal of anger, as he confessed in a 1961 radio interview: "To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost all of the time — and in one's work."
The 1960s not only saw the civil rights movement in the US, but also independence movements on the African continent, with which Baldwin had an ambivalent relationship.
His ancestors had been brought to the US as slaves.
This, he wrote, uprooted him and all his descendants and alienated them from Africa.
But on a trip to West Africa, he felt like an intruder.
He abandoned his plan to write a series of articles about Africa, out of respect, he said.
Berlin journalist Rene Aguigah has just published a biography of the writer, entitled "James Baldwin.
The Witness — A Portrait."
In an interview with DW, Aquigah said, "Africa was important to Baldwin.
At that time, many African Americans were interested in Africa — and therefore also in their own history.
In Baldwin's case, there was also the fact that his stepfather's mother lived with his family, and she was born into slavery.
That means he was in touch with this history."
With the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, the civil rights movement also lost its momentum.
Baldwin returned to Europe, resigned and angry.
The American dream, he declared, was over for him.
His view of the US became that of a distant observer.
Baldwin himself was somewhat forgotten.
It was the Black Lives Matter movement that brought him and his work back into the public consciousness, especially his sharp-eyed essays.
In them, he analyzes the everyday violence and racism that had not yet been overcome.
His biographer Rene Aguigah recommends one of Baldwin's essay volumes to newcomers as introductory reading: "The Fire Next Time" (1963).
It is a comprehensive look at the situation of African Americans in the early 1960s and a good introduction because, in it, Baldwin touches on many aspects of his own life — focusing on the major political circumstances.
James Baldwin died of cancer in 1987 at the age of 63.
He is buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.
As Pakistan works on enacting economic reforms under a new multibillion-dollar IMF bailout, Islamabad must first figure out what to do with its mountain of debt owed to China.
After cash-strapped Pakistan secured a new $7 billion (€6.5 billion) bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July, Islamabad has started talks with Beijing on reprofiling billions in Chinese debt as it seeks to enact economic reforms.
On the table are proposals to delay at least $16 billion in energy sector debt to China, along with extending the term of a $4 billion cash loan facility due to depleting foreign exchange reserves.
Last week, Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb was in Beijing to present proposals on extending the maturity of debt for nine power plants built by Chinese companies under the multibillion-dollar Pakistan China Economic Corridor (CPEC).
On Friday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told a federal cabinet meeting that he had written a letter to the Chinese government requesting debt reprofiling, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reported.
Reprofiling debt differs from restructuring debt in that the amount is not cut, rather, the due date for repayment is extended.
Islamabad is under immense pressure to renegotiate the expensive agreements with power producers, primarily Chinese companies, to bring down electricity prices.
Since CPEC was signed in 2015 and became one of largest components of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing has poured billions of dollars into developing infrastructure in Pakistan.
The value of CPEC projects comes in a $65 billion, with the primary goal of building a shipping connection for Chinese goods from Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea over the mountain border into China's Xinjiang region.
To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video CPEC has also earmarked billions of dollars in energy infrastructure development in Pakistan.
Azeem Khalid, an expert on Chinese investment in Pakistan, told DW, that the China-funded power plant development has exacerbated Pakistan's economic difficulties.
"Rather than establishing government-owned power plants, Pakistan allowed Chinese companies to operate as Independent Power Producers (IPP), leading to capacity payments regardless of production.
This essentially leads to the population paying for power they aren't using," Khalid said.
According to data from 2022, Pakistan has $26.6 billion (€24.6 billion) worth of Chinese debt, more than any other country in the world.
Safiya Aftab, an Islamabad based economist, told DW that the interest rates on Chinese loans are not concessional and come in at around 3.7%.
"These loans were given for infrastructure, which in theory is supposed to start generating returns.
The main issue in my opinion is Pakistan's poor absorption capacity.
The government was not able to progress on projects according to schedule," she said.
Analyst Khalid believes these loans "are challenging to repay due to exorbitantly high interest rates, which exceed the payment capacity of the government."
"The more relaxations and extensions available, the better it is for Pakistan.
China, aware of Pakistan's financial struggles, often provides breathing space but occasionally leverages this debt for its interests," said Khalid.
Analysts say that the CPEC loans were initially presented as the cheapest option for international loans, but it later emerged that they would be far more expensive to pay back than expected.
"The agreements, heavily favoring China, were poorly negotiated, resulting in the project being over-promised and under-delivered.
The public and media were misled by the then minister of planning and his team to portray CPEC as a significant economic game-changer for Pakistan and the region," Khalid said.
Economist Kaiser Bengali is of the view that changing the payment structure on Chinese debt "is only a temporary fix, which also depends on graciousness from the Chinese side, even if re-profiling and rollovers on loans from China have helped Pakistan fulfill its external financing needs several times in the past."
"The Chinese debt is huge and rollover is the only but temporary option.
"The huge debt pile is crushing the economy," he told DW.
"This is getting more complex, for how long China will roll over these debts, as they have their own bottom lines for these loans in their business projects.
They lend to many countries and don't want to set a precedent of delaying and renegotiating projects as it will affect their interests," he added.
Both Pakistani and Chinese officials frequently deflect criticism that the CPEC project has deepened Islamabad's economic woes and frame the scheme as an opportunity for economic growth.
A press release from Pakistan's Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives' "CPEC Secretariat" says Islamabad joined CPEC due to "favorable financing arrangements" and that China has "stepped forward to support Pakistan's development at a time when foreign investment had dried up."
"CPEC has provided enormous opportunities for Pakistan to grow economically.
It is an engine for economic growth," it added.

"Pakistan is trapped between China and the US [IMF loans], and Washington has cautioned that IMF loans should not be used to repay the mounting Chinese debt," Bengali said.
Economist Aftab said that China will allow Pakistan to reprofile its debt payment.
"The main reason for their generosity to Pakistan is their rivalry with India, and that's not going away anytime soon.
But they may lose patience on slow project progress and start pressing for action," she said.

What is the government doing to stop them?
A deadly stampede in Uttar Pradesh once again brought focus to India's self-styled godmen and the enormous and sometimes tragic influence they have over their followers.
The tragedy in India's northern town of Hathras in July saw over 120 people die during a religious gathering led by a self-styled godman.
Over 250,000 are believed to have attended the event.
The crowd reportedly started to stampede when godman's security detail pushed the followers who had knelt to collect the mud upon which the religious leader had walked.
The spiritual preacher Suraj Pal, popularly addressed as "Bhole Baba" (Innocent Elder), is just one of thousands of "godmen" in India.
He was once a constable with the Uttar Pradesh state police.
As a preacher, he now hosts scores of religious retreats around the country, drives ostentatious cars, commands a private security force, and counts the political elite and the deep-pocketed among his followers.
Pal and other self-styled Hindu ascetics have followers in every layer of society, from everyday people to celebrities.
A large amount of their money comes from their followers' donations, and some of the godmen claim to possess supernatural powers and divine connections.
However, in the last few years, an increasing number of so-called "spiritual" gurus or "godmen" in India have been implicated in crimes ranging from sexual abuse to murder.
In 2014, security forces had to push through a wall with bulldozers just to get their hands on guru Rampal Singh Jatin.
An estimated 20,000 troops had to contend with 10,000 of Rampal's fervent followers.
After securing his massive "ashram" or spiritual dwelling, they found the bodies of four women and an 18-month-old child buried on the grounds.
Four years later, he was sentenced to life in jail for murder.
There is also the case of Nityanand, a fugitive guru and self-proclaimed godman who is facing charges of abduction and rape in India.
He claims to have established his own island nation called the United States of Kailasa four years ago, reportedly off the coast of Ecuador.
Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim Insan, head of spiritual sect Dera Sacha Sauda in Punjab province, enjoyed venerable status among the lower caste Dalit Sikhs and other groups.
He made headlines in 2017 when he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping two female disciples.
Two years ago, he was found guilty on two charges of murder.
Another spiritual leader, Swami Premamnanda, escaped the pogrom in Sri Lanka in 1983 and later gathered many followers in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
The self-styled godman was eventually convicted of raping 13 girls.
He died in prison.
"Millions of people in both rural and urban India are looking for a purpose and a cause in their lives.
They want someone to gratify their spiritual needs and find such a person who they can trust and then become part of that identity," journalist Bhavdeep Kang told DW.

In many cases, according to Kang, new technologies played a hand in transforming the generic family advisor or village "saint" into a high-flying celebrity.
Many devotees flock to them for solutions to problems ranging from health issues to unemployment and fertility.
"The high-profile ones have money and are brands with deep influence on electoral politics and markets.
They comprise entire corporations and economies," Kang adds.
Dhirendra Krishna Shastri, popularly known as Bageshwar Dham Sarkar, is one such example from central state of Madhya Pradesh.
He claims divine powers, including the ability to heal the sick, but also claims he can help people overcome business and financial problems.
Counting powerful government ministers and politicians among his followers, Bageshwar is also a social media phenomenon with millions of followers.
He burst into the national limelight after a public figure questioned his claims that he had healing powers and could read people's minds.
There is also the case of Mata Amritanandamayi, the "hugging saint" affectionately called "Amma" by her followers, whose legacy includes a huge network of charities, schools, and shelters across the world.
The spiritual therapist from the southern Indian state of Kerala does not ascribe herself to any specific religious doctrine.
"My religion is love.
An unbroken stream of love flows from me to all beings in the universe," Amma told DW in an interview years ago.
Her supporters include doctors, rock stars, tycoons, and software engineers, as well as many who have abandoned their previous careers to be in her service.
Sociologist Dipankar Gupta, who has studied the issue closely, points out that steadfast rationalists find it difficult to fathom the faith and adoration that gurus and godmen invoke in their followers.
"Rationalists commit a major error here in their reasoning because science is not everything.
They go wrong because the lens they see the world with is not bifocal.
They just know and see a single method," Gupta told DW.
"To ask then why religious believers are not scientific is the most unscientific question of all," added Gupta.
However, educator Avijit Pathak sees these less-than-holy members of India's massive religious network as problematic and thriving alongside genuine spiritual leaders.
"The religiosity of love and compassion has been replaced by the politics of oppressive organized religions.
The meditative quest for the merger of the finite and the infinite has been replaced by the instantaneous salvation capsules sold by the fancy 'spiritual industry' of the neoliberal market," Pathak told DW.
"The utter existential anguish of the downtrodden has been exploited by the manipulators," added Pathak.

Germany has strict laws when a building project clashes with wildlife conservation.
But does it make sense to spend millions just to protect a few animals?
The provocative headlines scandalized readers of Bild newspaper, quickly making the rounds on social media in Germany and abroad.
In mid-July, the tabloid was outraged that the city of Erfurt, in the eastern state of Thuringia, was planning to spend nearly €2.5 million ($2.7 million) to relocate "of all things, hamsters" — 39 of which are standing in the way of a school expansion project due to start in 2026.
Doing some quick math, the newspaper pointed out this would come to about €64,102 per hamster, according to city documents.
The news came a few days after Bild accused the state government of neighboring Saxony-Anhalt of "squandering tax money" on monitoring programs for the European hamster and other animals.
The news also wasn't well-received by some Erfurt residents.
"€2.5 million — where do they get that sum?
They should simply box them up and resettle them somewhere else," one resident told regional public broadcaster MDR.
"In the case of Erfurt, it is of course an incredible amount of money," said Stefan Petzold, a land use and urban development consultant with German environmental association NABU.
But he pointed out that it was no simple task to find a suitable home for this animal, one of Germany's most critically endangered mammals.
Hamsters live almost exclusively in low-lying fertile farmland, where they can easily burrow in the soft, plowed soil and find a reliable food source.
Modern farming techniques and pesticides have destroyed European hamster habitats in recent decades, wiping out 99% of the German population.
"The animals have adapted to their environment, and can't live just anywhere," said Petzold.
A suitable field will have to be found, purchased and prepared for the hamsters with pre-drilled hamster holes and planted with winter wheat, lupins and peas, to give them the best possible chance of survival.
Once that's ready, the animals will be catalogued and collected, moved and then regularly monitored for years to ensure they've adapted to their new habitat.
However, despite the extra work to save the hamsters, Petzold finds the media outrage over the building project overblown.
"It's not the hamsters that are impeding this building project, it's bad planning," he said, suggesting that had project managers found out about the hamsters earlier in the process, they could have come up with an alternative location.
"Usually, nature conservation costs are quite low for building projects — generally less than 5% of the total construction costs."
"Species protection is one of the biggest obstacles to construction in this city," Klaus-Martin Groth, a former high-ranking judge in Berlin, told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper in May.
"Investors today never know exactly whether they will be able to realize their plans."
Groth's firm represents one of two companies that wanted to invest €60 million in the Cleantech Business Park in the Berlin district of Marzahn — before the Berlin administration court ruled against the planned construction due to the possible presence of the European green toad.
Germany's strict conservation regulations will mean "fewer homes, fewer schools […] and fewer jobs," said Groth.
"There are people who generally consider this to be desirable, but apparently ignore the fact that this may mean encroaching on previously unspoiled nature and landscapes elsewhere."
In June, the Berlin Senate adopted a draft law that would speed up planning, approval and construction processes in the city, especially when it comes to housing.
Part of the new legislation would simplify laws on nature and species protection, among other things, to the extent permitted by EU and federal law.
But environmentalists aren't sure whether the proposed changes would make things faster — and whether they are even legally permissible.
Verena Riedl, a biodiversity expert with NABU, said she often hears that "species conservation is putting the brakes on construction projects," and that regulations and length planning processes in Germany "are too far-reaching and too strict."
Under Germany's nature conservation law, developers are "obliged to refrain from causing avoidable damage to nature and the landscape," and "balance out" or "replace" any unavoidable damage to biodiversity.
The law is in line with the European Union 1992 Habitats Directive, which aims to conserve Europe's wild flora and fauna.
That means the rules for the protection of endangered biodiversity are similar across the EU, said Riedl, adding that this was apparently not clear to some stakeholders in Germany.
But Petzold, who previously worked for the planning office of a large engineering firm, said building delays can't always be pinned on environmental protection.
Often, project managers don't include conservationists until late in the process.
And, he said, the problem can also be traced to a lack of cooperation and communication between the different departments involved in the project — even when they're in the same building.
"All too often, people don't look at the bigger picture," he said.
Germany's digitalization delay and the lack of online tools, he added, meant it was difficult for building planners to easily reference previous material related to a project and speed up the process.
This isn't the first time hamsters have been relocated for a building project.
US chipmaker Intel, which is planning to build a €30-billion factory near Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, has already cleared the 400-hectare (988-acre) site of dozens of hamsters, moving them to a provisional site that will eventually allow them to integrate back into the wild.
Deutsche Bahn regularly finds new homes for animals living on the site of a future rail line or renovated train station.
Over the years, Germany's national railway company has rehoused rare birds and lizards in Baden-Württemberg, toads in North Rhine-Westphalia and even entire anthills from stations in Berlin and Brandenburg.
In some cases, a sniffer dog is brought in to help locate hard-to-find creatures in overgrown sites.
Perhaps the most high-profile clash between animals and builders took place in Dresden, during the construction of the long-awaited bridge of the Elbe River.
The proposed site for the bridge was suspected as being a habitat of the tiny lesser horseshoe bat, critically endangered in Germany.
In 2013, bridge construction went ahead — costing the Elbe Valley its UNESCO World Heritage status — and the bats were accommodated with €200,000 in shrub plantations and a 30 kilometer per hour (18.6 miles per hour) speed limit, still partially in place today.
Faced with criticism that species conservation shouldn't always be a priority — especially when it comes to saving a few dozen hamsters — Riedl pointed out that under the EU Habitats Directive, Germany is responsible for the conservation of this species threatened with extinction and that ignoring biodiversity loss was a very "short-term way of thinking."
Some 35% of the Germany's native animal species are endangered, and the biomass of insect populations has dropped by over 75% over the last few decades, even in some nature reserves.
And it's not just a problem in Germany.
"We have to protect the species for as long as they're around, because once they're extinct, you can't bring them back," said Riedl.
For an ecosystem to function normally, she added, the number of species can't fall below a certain level — and we don't know which species, and how many, are crucial to maintain a healthy ecosystem.
Even mosquitoes have a function, even if it's 'just' food for birds."

"Of course, schools and public infrastructure are important, but just nature conservation is just as much in the public interest — the fact that we can breathe fresh air, that we have green areas for recreation and which provide a habitat for other species," he said.
"Ultimately, we are giving a voice to nature, which cannot protect itself."

The festival originated in the 19th century after a cholera epidemic.
At the time, survivors wanted to thank the goddess Mahakali for health and her protection, and believers now go on doing so.
Mahakali is the goddess of time and death.
The religious devotion lasts for the entire Hindu month of Ashada Masam, which is usually in July or August.
A transgender person performs during the Ashada Bonalu festival celebrations at Golconda Fort in Hyderabad.
The festival begins at this historic site and travels from there to other temples in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad in the state of Telangana.
A dancer balances decorated pots of cooked rice as an offering to the goddess Mahakali.
Women prepare offerings of rice, milk and sugar in elaborately decorated pots.
These are brought to the temple by people in colorful clothing.
The festivities are accompanied by traditional drumming and dancing that emphasize the spiritual significance of the festival.
An artist dressed as the Hindu goddess Mahakali performs during a procession for the Bonalu festival in Hyderabad.
The processions are led by Pothuraju, the symbolic brother of the goddess.
The dancers drive away evil spirits and accompany the devotees with powerful performances.
These processions are a highlight of the festival.
Watch out, keep your distance — this procession includes a fire stunt.
On the third Sunday, the festival reaches its climax at the Ujjaini Mahakali temple in Secunderabad.
Thousands of pilgrims gather to pray and make offerings.
They want to express deep piety and experience joy as a community.
Dancers and spectators are equally enthusiastic here.
Locals and tourists come to experience spiritual and cultural diversity.
Today, Bonalu symbolizes the cultural identity and unity of the southeastern state of Telangana, which became independent only in 2014 after a long struggle.
The governor of the northern Indian state of Haryana takes part in the Ghatasthapana Ghatam procession with supporters — here in New Delhi.
At the closing ceremony, priests make offerings and pray for the protection and prosperity of the community in the coming year.
The goddess is asked to return and renew her blessings, completing the spiritual cycle.

The Lancet Commission on dementia said in its 2024 report that 14 lifestyle factors make up 45% of a person's risk — a guide to reduce your risk.
More than 55 million people worldwide live with some form of dementia or cognitive impairment.
In the next three decades that number is predicted to triple — climbing to 152 million people by 2050.
Dementia is often presented as an inevitable threat that looms in the distance of old age.
Its causes are baked in with genetic risks and the advancing state of human aging — or so the thinking goes.
But scientists are discovering that dementia is not set in stone.
A large-scale reevaluation of the science, published by the Lancet medical journal, concluded that many more dementia cases could be avoided than previously believed.
About 45% of the risk of developing dementia is due to 14 health factors.
The Lancet Commission report, compiled by 27 leading dementia experts, updates a previous list of risk factors.
The 2024 list included two new risks: high cholesterol and vision loss.
"This is important as, by understanding and acting on true risk factors of dementia, we can indeed delay, or prevent some cases of dementia," said Sarah-Naomi James, an expert in aging diseases at University College London in the UK.
James was not involved in writing the Lancet report.
Dementia is a group of many diseases, but the most common form is Alzheimer's disease.
It is caused by damaged nerve cells in the brain and causes confusion and memory loss.
People with dementia often cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change.
Around half of the risk factors for dementia are due to genetic mutations, which we inherit from our parents and grandparents.
But 45% of our dementia risk is due to 14 environmental risk factors and can therefore be reduced, the Lancet commission on dementia said.
The two new risk factors are associated with 9% of all dementia cases: 7% of cases are attributable to "bad" cholesterol from the age of 40 years, and 2% of cases are attributable to untreated vision loss in later life.
Other risk factors are lower levels of education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, air pollution and social isolation.
Together, they make up 40% of dementia risk.
The study authors call on national and international government bodies to be ambitious about dementia prevention.
"Actions to decrease dementia risk should begin early and continue throughout life," the authors wrote.
Currently, two-thirds of people with dementia live in developing countries.
People in China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa are likely to be worst hit as the global population ages.
The authors wrote that there was "more potential for reduction in risk in low-income and middle-income countries and among minoritized and lower socioeconomic groups."
In particular, reducing pollution levels, increasing educational standards in children, and promoting midlife cognitive activity could significantly reduce dementia risks.
The report offers guidelines for governments and health authorities to reduce dementia risk across people's lifespans, including: "If we did simple things well, such as screening for some of the factors identified in this report, with adequate resources to perform this, we have the potential to prevent dementia on a national scale," said Masud Husain, a neurologist at the University of Oxford in the UK.
Husain was not involved in the report.
"This would be far more cost-effective than developing high-tech treatments which so far have been disappointing in their impacts on people with established dementia," said Husain in a statement.
Researchers have been looking for medical treatments for dementia for decades, but their successes have been limited.
New hope arose after the discovery of a medicine called lecanemab, which slows the development of some forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's in its early stages.
But the drug has proved controversial.
Lecanemab was approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA) rejected the drug for use in the European market in July 2024.
The EMA reasoned the benefits of lecanemab did not outweigh the risks of a patient having serious side effects.
Scientists are still working to understand the disease's underlying biology.
Without a better understanding of how dementia damages the brain, it's difficult to create new treatments to halt or reverse cognitive decline.
James highlighted that scientists still had major gaps in understanding how the 14 dementia risk factors highlighted by the Lancet were linked with dementia-related changes in the brain.
"We don't know how these factors [such as blood pressure] are affecting dementia risk, and which aspects of dementia pathology type and development are conferring this risk," James said, adding that the report's recommendations ought to be encouraged by anyone interested in encouraging people to live healthier lives overall.

Every year since 1990, the small town of Wacken in northern Germany has become a place of pilgrimage for heavy metal heads.
Back then, just six local bands performed in front of 800 visitors.
Today, 180 bands and more than 80,000 fans from over 80 countries travel to Wacken.
Imaginative and almost professional costumes have long been part of the cult festival.
Thousands of visitors arrived in tents and camper vans the day before the festival began and enjoyed ideal weather of around 20 degrees Celsius (69 degrees Fahrenheit) without rain.
In 2023, downpours had made the festival site so muddy that only 61,000 of the 85,000 visitors were allowed to enter.
At least those who were sent home got their money back and a right of first refusal for this year.
The constant development and commitment of the organizers make Wacken a permanent fixture in the festival calendar.
Although globally active investors have now joined the Wacken Open Air company, founders Holger Hübner and Thomas Jensen (middle) also opened the 2024 edition themselves.
Scorpions singer Klaus Meine described the Wacken Open Air as one of the most beautiful and successful festivals in the world.
The Scorpions will be headlining for the third time in the last two decades.
Meine raves about the unique atmosphere, the loyal fans and the organizers who have turned the festival into a five-day spectacle.
For a week, the otherwise quiet community is transformed into a raucous festival site.
The inhabitants of Wacken warmly welcome the metal fans and benefit economically from the crowds.
Local businesses and clubs get involved to offer visitors an unforgettable experience.
The 240-hectare (593-acre) festival site is the size of 340 football pitches, but it is more than just a campsite with a stage.
Organizers and numerous sponsors have set up a kind of fairground, including a medieval spectacle called Wackinger Village.
The centerpiece, however, is the infield with the two main stages, "Faster" and "Harder."
Many non-metal fans are familiar with headliners such as Iron Maiden, Metallica and Slipknot.
Another highlight is Pantera's reunion performance.
The band broke up in 2003.
In addition to the two main stages, smaller stages offer space for newcomers and unusual acts such as the band MegaBosch (photo) from Hanover.
The Wacken Open Air is more than just music.
It is a place where cultures come together.
Workshops and culinary highlights from all over the world enrich the festival.
The special atmosphere is created by people of different origins and interests coming together.
Alonso Ramos and his band Fleshless Entity, for example, come from El Salvador.
Wacken Open Air 2024 will set new standards once again.
The mixture of legendary bands and those who want to become legendary, innovative concepts and the special community make the festival unrivalled for many fans.
A small indication of this: The 85,000 tickets at around €350 were sold out within four and a half hours.

Declaration on Digital Accessibility on DW.com DW (Deutsche Welle) strives to make its website accessible to everyone.
The web presence should be designed in such a way that it is in accordance with the national legislation on implementing the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament.
This declaration on accessibility applies to the version of this website currently accessible on the Internet: www.dw.com.
When was the declaration on accessibility created?
This declaration was created or respectively revised on July 24, 2024.
How accessible is the website?
The website dw.com is generally accessible without barriers.
For example, the colors used have sufficiently strong contrasts, the text size can be changed, images are provided with a descriptive text (alt tag) and the offer is optimized for the use of reading aloud applications (screen reader).
Subtitles are increasingly offered for audiovisual content.
Which areas are not yet barrier-free?
Some functions and sections are not yet fully accessible.
These include:   Barrier: ARIA Landmarks Description: The awarding of dw.com has not yet been fully completed.
As a result the ARIA Landmark for the main content of a website has not yet been awarded Measures: dw.com is constantly being improved.
Fixing this issue is a work in progress.
Time schedule: Expected resolution in 2025.
Barrier: Labeling of form fields Description: Currently, the user data fields in our forms do not use autocomplete attributes, which are necessary to make the fields easier to fill out.
Additionally, some fields lack clear labels, making it difficult to understand what the selections refer to.
This can cause screen readers to produce confusing outputs.
Measures: dw.com is constantly being improved.
Barrier: Buttons Description: dw.com uses some individually designed buttons.
The design and labeling of these buttons does not yet meet the latest WCAG 2.1 requirements.
This applies to various buttons on article pages, structure pages and personal pages.
Barrier: Error messages in form fields Description: Error messages are not positioned in the label or directly next to the form field, making them hard to identify and associate correctly.
Barrier: Mouseover Description: Currently a mouseover or hover box effect is not available for all elements.
This applies to the logo, the rich text links and the main navigation.
Measures: dw.com will be continuously developed.
The barrier was recognized and is in the development stage.
Barrier: Non-Text Content Lacks Descriptive Alternative Text Description: Some images either lack alternative text or have alternative text that is not descriptive enough.
This makes it difficult for blind users and screen readers to interpret these graphics.
Barrier: Contrast Mode Description: When using the contrast mode of the Windows operating system, the display of some elements of the website is currently not WCAG compliant.
This applies to the main navigation and overlays.
Barrier: Navigation Description: Due to technical reasons, there is no breadcrumb navigation for additional orientation.
Barrier: Search Description: The search mechanism as an additional access path is not yet implemented in the current development on dw.com.
Barrier: Marking of words Description: Due to technical limitations, it is currently not possible to highlight individual words in a different language.
Barrier: Adjustable Text Spacing Description: Due to technical limitations, embedded external iFrames cannot adapt to personalized text size and spacing settings.
Barrier: Video Description: The videos provided on dw.com are currently not WCAG compliant.
This applies to the specification of a subtitle as well as the presentation of a media alternative.
